cf-postgresql-broker
====================

Proof-of-concept Postgres service broker for Cloud Foundry

This service broker has a number of key limitations (such as not generating a unique password for each service instance), but it does fully implement the service broker API.

For usage instructions, see <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/running/architecture/services/managing-service-brokers.html">this page</a> of Cloud Foundry's documentation.
